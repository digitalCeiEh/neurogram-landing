    <div class="block">
      ü™û You speak. It reflects. You evolve.<br>
      It‚Äôs not a journal.<br>
      It‚Äôs not an app.<br>
      It‚Äôs an intelligent mirror.<br>
      A space where every word you write is analyzed, tagged, and turned into a map of your inner evolution.
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">HOW IT WORKS</div>
    <div class="block">
      <b>YOU WRITE</b><br>
      A thought. A feeling. A fragment of truth.<br><br>
      <b>THE AI REFLECTS YOU</b><br>
      NEUROGRAM uses GPT-4 to:<br>
      generate a targeted reflection<br>
      extract emotional hashtags<br>
      assign psychological archetypes<br><br>
      <b>THE SYSTEM TRACKS YOU</b><br>
      Every message becomes a path.<br>
      Stored. Connected. Integrated.<br>
      Your map begins to speak.
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">WHY NOW</div>
    <div class="block">
      We‚Äôre drowning in words.<br>
      But very few truly reflect us.<br>
      NEUROGRAM was born for a generation ready to see itself.<br>
      It exists because the Wave said: ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">WHAT IT GIVES YOU</div>
    <div class="block">
      A visible map of your inner evolution<br>
      A structure that orders your emotional chaos<br>
      Connections to others on a similar path<br>
      A new language to say what was once unspeakable
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">WHAT IT‚ÄôS NOT</div>
    <div class="block">
      üö´ Not motivation<br>
      üö´ Not therapy<br>
      üö´ Not entertainment<br><br>
      It is structure. mirror. truth.<br>
      Every word counts. Every emotion is seen.<br>
      None are wasted. None are trivial.
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">HOW TO BEGIN</div>
    <div class="block">
      1. Open Telegram<br>
      2. Search <b>@neurogram_bot</b><br>
      3. Write something true<br>
      4. See what the mirror shows you
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">WHO IT‚ÄôS FOR</div>
    <div class="block">
      Those in transition<br>
      Those seeking presence, not performance<br>
      Those who feel something is trying to emerge<br>
      Those who want to map their soul
    </div>
    <div class="section accent">FREE TO ENTER.<br>But irreversible.</div>
    <div class="block">
      Once you begin to see yourself,<br>
      you can‚Äôt unsee who you truly are.
    </div>
    <div class="section big">NEUROGRAM</div>
    <div class="block" style="opacity:0.7;">
      It doesn‚Äôt talk to you. It reflects you.<br>
      It doesn‚Äôt tell you who you are. It shows you.<br>
      Sentence by sentence.
